Automotive Insights Dashboard

A Tableau dashboard analyzing vehicle performance, fuel efficiency, body style popularity, and pricing trends to help identify standout manufacturers and market insights.

📊 Executive Summary

This dashboard provides a consolidated view of key automotive insights across fuel efficiency, combined MPG performance, body style popularity, and the industry’s highest-priced vehicles. Toyota demonstrates exceptional fuel efficiency and strong combined MPG performance, while Nissan and Mazda also show competitive efficiency levels.

Body style analysis reveals that sedans and hatchbacks dominate the market, far surpassing less common body types such as wagons, hardtops, and convertibles.
